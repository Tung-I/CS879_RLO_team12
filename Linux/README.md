# Tutorial for a first-time Linux user

#### Reasons for learning Linux
Linux offers a comprehensive hardware control and resource management framework at the lowest level of the operating system. Thanks to its open-source nature, Linux-based products and operating systems can be customized to meet the specific requirements of developers.

While the Linux command line in Ubuntu may appear daunting and complex at first, it is actually a simple and intuitive interface once you grasp its functionality. Although the Graphical User Interface (GUI) may seem more straightforward, the command line is better suited for certain tasks.

For example, software installation on Windows typically entails downloading a setup file, running an installer, and managing potential compatibility issues or dependencies. Conversely, Ubuntu's package manager, APT (Advanced Packaging Tool), enables easy installation and updates of software packages through the command line, with seamless management of updates. This simplifies the process of keeping your system secure and up-to-date.

Proficiency in the Linux command line (BASH) is a valuable skill to add to your toolkit. This tutorial aims to provide a foundation in installing Ubuntu, using the command line, creating shell scripts to make the computer perform useful tasks, and setting up your environment to run applications. The tutorial intends to provide sufficient knowledge to enable users to carry out productive work. Additionally, for those interested in developing more advanced skills, we also provide links to useful blogs and websites for further learning.

## Goals and Learning Outcomes
The tutorial has the following learning outcomes with regards to practice and useful technologies: 
- Learn how to install the Ubuntu operating system on a machine.
