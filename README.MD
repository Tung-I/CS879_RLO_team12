# Reusable Learning Object (RLO)

**Team 12**: Tung-I Chen, Uma Pal, Alexandra Burushkina

**Target**: CS 325 Intro-to-HCI

As students in CS 325 would be required to build an application using modern machine learning techniques, this tutorial provides a comprehensive foundation in Linux, Python development, and app development that will be highly relevant to their final project. The skills and tools covered in this tutorial, such as installing Nvidia driver and CUDA, using Jupyter Notebooks, and leveraging Google Appsheet, will enable students to build powerful and effective applications that analyze and interpret human-computer interactions. This tutorial will provide students with a solid foundation in modern computing and machine learning techniques, which they can leverage in their HCI projects to develop cutting-edge applications that meet the needs of end-users.

## Goals and Learning Outcomes
#### Tutorial for a first-time Linux user
- The first part of this tutorial covers a range of topics related to Linux and Python development. You'll start by learning how to **install the Ubuntu operating system** on a machine, which will be the foundation for the rest of the tutorial. From there, you'll gain knowledge of **essential Linux commands** that every user should know, which will help you navigate the system and perform common tasks.

- Next, you'll learn how to automate repetitive tasks and save time using **bash scripts**. Bash is a command-line shell used in Linux, and it is incredibly powerful for automating tasks and streamlining workflows. You'll also acquire the skill to develop Python applications in a **virtual environment**, which is an essential practice for improving portability and preventing conflicts in package dependencies.

- Finally, you'll learn how to **install Nvidia driver and CUDA** for GPU-driven applications. If you plan on using your machine for data science or machine learning workloads, you'll need to install these components to take advantage of GPU acceleration.

#### Tutorial for a first-time Python user
- The second part of the tutorial focuses on the **Anaconda** distribution for Python, which is a popular platform for scientific computing and data science. You'll learn how to install and set up Anaconda, create and manage virtual environments using Conda, and use **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive programming and documentation. Jupyter Notebooks are an excellent tool for data exploration and prototyping, and they allow you to combine code, text, and visualizations in a single document.

#### Tutorial for building your own app
- The final part of the tutorial introduces **Google Appsheet**, a platform for building mobile and web applications without writing any code. You'll learn how to use the platform to create an app, which will be a culmination of the skills you've learned throughout the tutorial. By the end of the tutorial, you should have a solid understanding of Linux, Python development, and app development, and you'll be equipped to take your skills to the next level.
