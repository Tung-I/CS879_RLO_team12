# Linux-Tutorial

Linux provides a complete framework for hardware control and resource management at the lowest level of the operating system. This framework follows the good tradition of Unix and is therefore quite stable and powerful. Additionally, because this excellent framework can run on current personal computers (x86 systems), many software developers have shifted their work to this framework, so the Linux operating system also has many application software available.
