# Tutorial for a first-time Linux user

Linux provides a complete framework for hardware control and resource management at the lowest level of the operating system Due to Linuxâ€™s open-source nature, Linux-based products and operating systems can be shaped to meet the demands of the developer.

At first, the Linux command line in Ubuntu may seem daunting, complex and scary compared to Windows or MacOS. It is actually quite simple and intuitive once you understand what is going on that. The Graphical User Interface might be much easier at the first sight but some tasks are more suited to the command line.

For instance, in Windows, installing software often involves downloading a setup file, running an installer, and dealing with potential compatibility issues or dependencies. Managing updates can also be more complicated, especially when dealing with multiple programs. On the other hand, Ubuntu uses a package manager called APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) which makes it easy to install and update software packages from the command line. Updates are also handled seamlessly with the same package manager. This makes it much easier to keep your system up-to-date and secure.

The knowledge and skills abourt Linux command line (BASH) is definitely a tool you can add to your belt. The tutorial intends to give you a foundation in how to install Ubuntu, how to use the command line, and how to get the computer to do useful work for you with shell scripts, and how to create a virtual enviroment to run applications in it. The aim of this tutorial is to get you started and give you just enough that you can do useful work. For those who are interested in developing more advanced skills, we also provides the links to some useful blogs and websites for future learning.
