# Linux-Tutorial

Linux provides a complete framework for hardware control and resource management at the lowest level of the operating system. This framework follows the good tradition of Unix and is therefore quite stable and powerful. Additionally, because this excellent framework can run on current personal computers (x86 systems), many software developers have shifted their work to this framework, so the Linux operating system also has many application software available. Ubuntu, on the other hand, is a popular Linux distribution. One of the main advantages of using Ubuntu over other Linux distributions is its focus on ease of use and user-friendliness.

At first, the Linux command line in Ubuntu may seem daunting, complex and scary compared to Windows and MacOS. It is actually quite simple and intuitive once you understand what is going on that. The Graphical User Interface could be much easier at the first sight but some tasks are more suited to the command line, such as data manipulation and file management. For instance, in Windows, installing software often involves downloading a setup file, running an installer, and dealing with potential compatibility issues or dependencies. Managing updates can also be more complicated, especially when dealing with multiple programs. On the other hand, Ubuntu uses a package manager called APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) which makes it easy to install and update software packages from the command line. Updates are also handled seamlessly with the same package manager. This makes it much easier to keep your system up-to-date and secure.

As a CS-major student, the knowledge and skills abourt Linux command line (BASH) is definitely a tool you can add to your belt. The following pages are intended to give you a foundation in how to use the terminal and get the computer to do useful work for you.
